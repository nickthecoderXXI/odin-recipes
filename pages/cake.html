  <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a super moist soft and tasty coconut cake. Cakes like this are very popular amongst children.</p> 
    <p>It is good especially with a cup of coffee on the side.</p> 
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>1 cups butter, softened</li>
      <li>4 eggs, separated</li>
      <li>1 cups unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch cake pan.</li>
      <li>Beat sugar, butter, and egg yolks together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy; add shredded coconut.</li>
      <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Stir creamed butter mixture, alternating with coconut milk, into flour mixture until batter is just mixed.</li>
      <li>Beat egg whites in a glass or metal bowl until until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites will form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold egg whites into batter. Pour batter into the prepared cake pan.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes.</li>   
    </ol>
